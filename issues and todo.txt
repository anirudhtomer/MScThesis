ISSUES:
High autocorrelation at smaller lags
autocorrelation decreases slowly like an AR process
Tiny bit of label switching
very slow mixing as model gets complex

TODO:
checking multicollinearity
label switching issues: stephens paper
try hierarchical, conditional conjuagate priors in mixture model
try marginal model
try sigma (eta. mu) = 0

RECENTLY DONE:
Better starting values does work at times
also choosing different priors for eta when the component is empty doesn't always work
