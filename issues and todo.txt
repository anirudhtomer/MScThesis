ISSUES:
autocorrelation decreases slowly like an AR process
Tiny bit of label switching
very slow mixing as model gets complex

TODO:
checking multicollinearity
label switching issues: stephens paper
try hierarchical, conditional conjuagate priors in mixture model
try sigma (eta. mu) = 0
try regression with fixed effects to have good starting values

implement marginal model with bayesian heterogeneity
