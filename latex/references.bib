	title = {Linear {Mixed} {Models} for {Longitudinal} {Data}},
	isbn = {978-1-4419-0299-3},
	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of linear mixed models for continuous longitudinal data. Next to model formulation, this edition puts major emphasis on exploratory data analysis for all aspects of the model, such as the marginal model, subject-specific profiles, and residual covariance structure. Further, model diagnostics and missing data receive extensive treatment. Sensitivity analysis for incomplete data is given a prominent place. Several variations to the conventional linear mixed model are discussed (a heterogeity model, conditional linear mid models). This book will be of interest to applied statisticians and biomedical researchers in industry, public health organizations, contract research organizations, and academia. The book is explanatory rather than mathematically rigorous. Most analyses were done with the MIXED procedure of the SAS software package, and many of its features are clearly elucidated. How3ever, some other commercially available packages are discussed as well. Great care has been taken in presenting the data analyses in a software-independent fashion.

	abstract = {We present an integrated system with structural Gaussian mixture models (SGMMs) and a neural network for purposes of achieving both computational efficiency and high accuracy in text-independent speaker verification. A structural background model (SBM) is constructed first by hierarchically clustering all Gaussian mixture components in a universal background model (UBM). In this way the acoustic space is partitioned into multiple regions in different levels of resolution. For each target speaker, a SGMM can be generated through multilevel maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation from the SBM. During test, only a small subset of Gaussian mixture components are scored for each feature vector in order to reduce the computational cost significantly. Furthermore, the scores obtained in different layers of the tree-structured models are combined via a neural network for final decision. Different configurations are compared in the experiments conducted on the telephony speech data used in the NIST speaker verification evaluation. The experimental results show that computational reduction by a factor of 17 can be achieved with 5\% relative reduction in equal error rate (EER) compared with the baseline. The SGMM-SBM also shows some advantages over the recently proposed hash GMM, including higher speed and better verification performance.},

It shows that if the distribution of random effects is a finite mixture of normal distributions, then the random effects may be badly estimated if normality is assumed, and the current methods for inspecting the appropriateness of the model assumptions are not sound. Further, it is argued that a better way to detect the components of the mixture is to build this assumption in the model and then "compare" the fitted model with the Gaussian model. All of this is illustrated on two practical examples},

	abstract = {Identifying and classifying action potential shapes in extracellular neural waveforms have long been the subject of research, and although several algorithms for this purpose have been successfully applied, their use has been limited by some outstanding problems. The first is how to determine shapes of the action potentials in the waveform and, second, how to decide how many shapes are distinct. A harder problem is that action potentials frequently overlap making difficult both the determination of the shapes and the classification of the spikes. In this report, a solution to each of these problems is obtained by applying Bayesian probability theory. By defining a probabilistic model of the waveform, the probability of both the form and number of spike shapes can be quantified. In addition, this framework is used to obtain an efficient algorithm for the decomposition of arbitrarily complex overlap sequences. This algorithm can extract many times more information than previous methods and facilitates the extracellular investigation of neuronal classes and of interactions within neuronal circuits.},

Recent evidence has shown that the Gaussian model does not accurately capture the multivariate statistics of the waveform samples’ distribution. We present further data demonstrating non-Gaussian statistics, and show that the multivariate t-distribution, a wide-tailed family of distributions, provides a significantly better fit to the true statistics. We introduce an adaptation of a new expectation-maximization based competitive mixture decomposition algorithm and show that it efficiently and reliably performs mixture decomposition of t-distributions. Our algorithm determines the number of units in multiunit neural recordings, even in the presence of significant noise contamination resulting from random threshold crossings and overlapping spikes.},

	abstract = {Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play important roles in a variety of biological processes. To properly function, RNA molecules usually have to fold to specific structures, and therefore understanding RNA structure is vital in comprehending how RNA functions. One approach to understanding and predicting biomolecular structure is to use knowledge-based potentials built from experimentally determined structures. These types of potentials have been shown to be effective for predicting both protein and RNA structures, but their utility is limited by their significantly rugged nature. This ruggedness (and hence the potential's usefulness) depends heavily on the choice of bin width to sort structural information (e.g. distances) but the appropriate bin width is not known a priori. To circumvent the binning problem, we compared knowledge-based potentials built from inter-atomic distances in RNA structures using different mixture models (Kernel Density Estimation, Expectation Minimization and Dirichlet Process). We show that the smooth knowledge-based potential built from Dirichlet process is successful in selecting native-like RNA models from different sets of structural decoys with comparable efficacy to a potential developed by spline-fitting — a commonly taken approach — to binned distance histograms. The less rugged nature of our potential suggests its applicability in diverse types of structural modeling.},
