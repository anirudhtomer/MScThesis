	abstract = {We consider Bayesian estimation of a finite mixture of models with random effects, which is also known as the heterogeneity model. First, we discuss the properties of various Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers that are obtained from full conditional Gibbs sampling by grouping and collapsing. Whereas full conditional Gibbs sampling turns out to be sensitive to the parameterization chosen for the mean structure of the model, the alternative sampler is robust in this respect. However, the logical extension of the approach to the sampling of the group variances does not further increase the efficiency of the sampler. Second, we deal with the identifiability problem due to the arbitrary labeling within the model. Finally, a case study involving metric conjoint analysis serves as a practical illustration.},

	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of linear mixed models for continuous longitudinal data. Next to model formulation, this edition puts major emphasis on exploratory data analysis for all aspects of the model, such as the marginal model, subject-specific profiles, and residual covariance structure. Further, model diagnostics and missing data receive extensive treatment. Sensitivity analysis for incomplete data is given a prominent place. Several variations to the conventional linear mixed model are discussed (a heterogeity model, conditional linear mid models). This book will be of interest to applied statisticians and biomedical researchers in industry, public health organizations, contract research organizations, and academia. The book is explanatory rather than mathematically rigorous. Most analyses were done with the MIXED procedure of the SAS software package, and many of its features are clearly elucidated. How3ever, some other commercially available packages are discussed as well. Great care has been taken in presenting the data analyses in a software-independent fashion.

Authored by the team that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book provides a practical introduction to this program and its use. The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked examples and a wide range of applications from various disciplines.  The book introduces regression models, techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide range of modelling issues before going into the vital area of hierarchical models, one of the most common applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions―all those aspects of the "art" of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions.   More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of "tricks" that reveal the real power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas.   Full code and data for examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found on the book’s website.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A too short recovery time after blood donation results in a gradual depletion of iron stores and a subsequent decline in hemoglobin (Hb) levels over time. This decline in Hb levels may depend on individual, unobserved characteristics of the donor.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a data set of 5388 Dutch blood donors from the Donor InSight study. The statistical analysis is based on a Bayesian growth mixture model, which assumes that each donor belongs to one of several groups. Each group implies a different Hb trajectory, and donors with similar longitudinal trajectories belong to the same group. Analyses were performed for male and female donors separately.
RESULTS: For both sexes the model identified four groups of donors. Stable Hb trajectories were found among 14\% of male donors and 15\% of female donors; declining Hb trajectories were observed in the remaining groups of donors. The percentage of donor deferrals differed strongly between groups.
CONCLUSION: The model can be used to predict to which group a donor belongs, and this prediction can be updated after each donation. This is of high practical importance because early identification of donors with declining Hb levels could help to tailor donation intervals and to prevent iron deficiency and donor deferrals.},

	abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

In particular, we study the two-stage hierarchical normal linear models, the Laird-Ware model for longitudinal data, and a general structure for hierarchically nested linear models.

A structural background model (SBM) is constructed first by hierarchically clustering all Gaussian mixture components in a universal background model (UBM). In this way the acoustic space is partitioned into multiple regions in different levels of resolution. For each target speaker, a SGMM can be generated through multilevel maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation from the SBM. During test, only a small subset of Gaussian mixture components are scored for each feature vector in order to reduce the computational cost significantly. Furthermore, the scores obtained in different layers of the tree-structured models are combined via a neural network for final decision. Different configurations are compared in the experiments conducted on the telephony speech data used in the NIST speaker verification evaluation. The experimental results show that computational reduction by a factor of 17 can be achieved with 5\% relative reduction in equal error rate (EER) compared with the baseline. The SGMM-SBM also shows some advantages over the recently proposed hash GMM, including higher speed and better verification performance.},

The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout. Author resource page: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/{\textasciitilde}gelman/arm/},

Consequently, Bayes factors for model comparisons can be routinely computed as a by-product of the simulation. Hitherto, this calculation has proved extremely challenging. Our approach exploits the fact that the marginal density can be expressed as the prior times the likelihood function over the posterior density. This simple identity holds for any parameter value. An estimate of the posterior density is shown to be available if all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. To improve accuracy, the posterior density is estimated at a high density point, and the numerical standard error of resulting estimate is derived. The ideas are applied to probit regression and finite mixture models.},

In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so-called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

We describe an alternative MCMC method which views the parameters of the model as a (marked) point process, extending methods suggested by Ripley to create a Markov birth-death process with an appropriate stationary distribution. Our method is easy to implement, even in the case of data in more than one dimension, and we illustrate it on both univariate and bivariate data. There appears to be considerable potential for applying these ideas to other contexts, as an alternative to more general reversible jump methods, and we conclude with a brief discussion of how this might be achieved.},

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of livestock weights is important for many aspects of livestock management including nutrition, production and appropriate dosing of pharmaceuticals. Subtherapeutic dosing has been shown to accelerate pathogen resistance which can have subsequent widespread impacts. There are a number of published models for the prediction of live weight from morphometric measurements of cattle, but many of these models use measurements difficult to gather and include complicated age, size and gender stratification. In this paper, we use data from the Infectious Diseases of East Africa calf cohort study and additional data collected at local markets in western Kenya to develop a simple model based on heart girth circumference to predict live weight of east African shorthorn zebu (SHZ) cattle. SHZ cattle are widespread throughout eastern and southern Africa and are economically important multipurpose animals. We demonstrate model accuracy by splitting the data into training and validation subsets and comparing fitted and predicted values. The final model is weight0.262 = 0.95 + 0.022 × girth which has an R 2 value of 0.98 and 95 \% prediction intervals that fall within the ±20 \% body weight error band regarded as acceptable when dosing livestock. This model provides a highly reliable and accurate method for predicting weights of SHZ cattle using a single heart girth measurement which can be easily obtained with a tape measure in the field setting.},

The first is how to determine shapes of the action potentials in the waveform and, second, how to decide how many shapes are distinct. A harder problem is that action potentials frequently overlap making difficult both the determination of the shapes and the classification of the spikes. In this report, a solution to each of these problems is obtained by applying Bayesian probability theory. By defining a probabilistic model of the waveform, the probability of both the form and number of spike shapes can be quantified. In addition, this framework is used to obtain an efficient algorithm for the decomposition of arbitrarily complex overlap sequences. This algorithm can extract many times more information than previous methods and facilitates the extracellular investigation of neuronal classes and of interactions within neuronal circuits.},

This approach combines the flexibility of semiparametric, latent class models that assume common parameters for each sub-population and the parsimony of random effects models that assume normal distributions for the regression parameters. The number of subpopulations is selected to maximize the posterior probability of the model being true. Simulations are presented which document the performance of the methodology for synthetic data with known heterogeneity and number of sub-populations.

To properly function, RNA molecules usually have to fold to specific structures, and therefore understanding RNA structure is vital in comprehending how RNA functions. One approach to understanding and predicting biomolecular structure is to use knowledge-based potentials built from experimentally determined structures. These types of potentials have been shown to be effective for predicting both protein and RNA structures, but their utility is limited by their significantly rugged nature. This ruggedness (and hence the potential's usefulness) depends heavily on the choice of bin width to sort structural information (e.g. distances) but the appropriate bin width is not known a priori. To circumvent the binning problem, we compared knowledge-based potentials built from inter-atomic distances in RNA structures using different mixture models (Kernel Density Estimation, Expectation Minimization and Dirichlet Process). We show that the smooth knowledge-based potential built from Dirichlet process is successful in selecting native-like RNA models from different sets of structural decoys with comparable efficacy to a potential developed by spline-fitting — a commonly taken approach — to binned distance histograms. The less rugged nature of our potential suggests its applicability in diverse types of structural modeling.},

	abstract = {Demand heterogeneity traditionally has been defined as segments of consumers that are homogeneous with regard to the benefits they seek or in their response to marketing programs (e.g., product offering, price discounts). Although it often is acknowledged that truly homogeneous segments of consumers do not exist, the approximation is assumed to be sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonable basis for the development of marketing strategy. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the homogeneous segment assumption might not be reasonable. By using a normal component mixture model that nests other, more commonly used models of heterogeneity, the authors find that the within-component heterogeneity remains substantial, even when multiple components are present. Predictive tests substantiate their finding of large within-component heterogeneity.},
