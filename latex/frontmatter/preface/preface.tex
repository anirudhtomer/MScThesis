\chapter{Preface}
\label{ch : preface}

The following thesis work was conducted as part of the programme completion requirements of MSc. Statistics programme at KU Leuven. When I began working on this project, I had little idea that I would be able to go as far as I have been now. There were many significant obstacles on the way, such as software implementation of Deviance Information Criteria for missing data models, software implementation of Bayes Factor, label switching and lack of computational power required for this work. The entire work for this thesis has been done using R and JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler).\\

I am grateful to my supervisor Professor Dr. Emmanuel Lesaffre for keeping faith in my capabilities and for guiding me towards the right path. I enjoyed the fact that he never spoonfed me, yet was always available to discuss the difficult parts of the work at hand. He set very clear goals at the beginning of the year and continually monitored my progress thereafter. My interest in Bayesian statistics has grown by magnitudes under his supervision and I am looking forward to contribute more in this area. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Professor Geert Molenberghs and Professor Geert Verbeke for the captivating lectures on longitudinal data analysis. They introduced me to mixed models and empowered me with the tools of trade required to do the frequentist analysis of blood donor data set in this report. I am thankful to Kazem Nasserinejad from ErasmusMC for resolving many of my queries regarding the blood donor data set. Igor Milhoranca and Jorne Biccler also gave much needed inputs at crucial times. Lastly, I am thankful to my parents for all the sacrifices they made to make sure I had as less obstacles as possible during my studies.\\
